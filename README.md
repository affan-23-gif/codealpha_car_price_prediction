## The dataset titled "Car price prediction(used cars)" available on Kaggle is designed for predicting the price of used cars based on various attributes. Here's an overview of its structure and contents:


#### Car_Name: Name of the car (categorical)
#### Year: Year of the car's manufacturing (numerical)
#### Selling_Price: Selling price of the car (target variable, numerical)
#### Present_Price: Current market price of the car (numerical)
#### Driven_kms: Kilometers driven by the car (numerical)
#### Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used by the car (categorical)
#### Selling_type: Selling type (categorical)
#### Transmission: Type of transmission (categorical)
#### Owner: Number of previous owners (numerical)

## Dataset Description:
This dataset is ideal for regression tasks where the goal is to predict the selling price of a used car based on its characteristics such as age (Year), current market price (Present_Price), kilometers driven (Driven_kms), fuel type (Fuel_Type), transmission type (Transmission), and more. It's suitable for learning regression modeling techniques, exploring feature engineering, and evaluating various machine learning algorithms.

This dataset provides a rich opportunity for exploration and experimentation in machine learning, particularly in the field of regression analysis applied to automotive data.

## Usage Examples:
Learning: Useful for understanding how to train a car price prediction model.
Research: Supports research in the domain of automotive pricing models.
Application: Applicable for developing real-world applications related to used car valuation.
